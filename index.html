	<title>Sir Felix's Information Repo</title>
    <h4>What is this?</h4>
    This is a website that I made to try and contribute somewhat to mostly the Homestuck and by extent CaNWC community putting up pages
	for information to be accessible to most people, and also to just mess around and see what goofy stuff I can make that someone
	stumbling across this site might enjoy.
    <h4>What is mostly hosted here?</h4>
    Well, I'm glad you asked. Here's a current directory of what is currently accessible on the site:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://sirfelic.github.io/canwc-direct/09-23-2016">CaNWC Direct Page for September 23rd, 2016. A page for watching the
		most recent Homestuck / CaNWC Community Streams.</a>
		<li><a href="https://sirfelic.github.io/canwc-direct/09-13-2016">CaNWC NX Direct Page for September 13th, 2016. It was a bad joke...</a>
		<li><a href="https://sirfelic.github.io/canwc-direct/09-03-2016">CaNWC Direct Page for September 3rd, 2016.</a>
		<li><a href="https://sirfelic.github.io/canwc-direct/archive">CaNWC Direct Archive Page. Mainly a page for past CaNWC Music Team
		streams and videos and other misc resources.</a>
		<li><a href="https://sirfelic.github.io/misc/homepage">Sir Felix's old stupid personal webpage that you shouldn't bother with.</a>
	</ul>
	There will most likely be more pages in the future, so keep watch for those.
    <h4>I have a suggestion for the site!</h4>

    <h4>Are you the only one that made this site?</h4>
    Of course not! Here's a list of people that helped a lot:

    <ul>
        <li>minishLAN, for helping me set up this website and also helping maintain it.</li>
        <li>Difarem, cookiefonster and jd6 for helping maintain the website aswell.</li>
        <li>SM64Guy, for the newspost CSS.</li>
        <li>Wheals, for helping me with a few resources (aswell as the way this site is layed out, thanks!), and also giving me some inspiration
		to actually work on something useful in the community from seeing his own website, <a href="https://wheals.github.io/">which you should
		totally check out for more Homestuck/CaNWC goodies!</a></li>
        <li>Makin, for being able to stream all the community streams you're able to find on this website.</li>
        <li>Nintendo, for the (very messy) Nintendo Direct-like CSS, and also giving some inspiration for the basis for CaNWC Directs.</li>
        <li>The CaNWC Music Team for being able to make such good music, art and content for the community after Homestuck ended!</li>
		<li>...and you! Thanks for visiting this website and having a reason to keep this thing up.</li>
